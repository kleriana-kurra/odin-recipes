    <p>Everyone loves a good lasagna, right? 
    It's a great way to feed a crowd and a perfect dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well. Leftovers will keep you happy for days.</p>
    <p>For this recipe, we are essentially making a thick, meaty tomato sauce and layering that with noodles and cheese into a casserole. Here's the run-down:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped green bell pepper</li>
        <li>¾ cup chopped onion</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 (26 ounce) jars pasta sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) container part-skim ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>2 huevos</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <lo>
        <li> <strong>Step 1.</strong>Cook the lasagna noodles in a large pot of boiling water for 10 minutes, or until al dente. Rinse with cold water, and drain.</li>
        <li> <strong>Step 2.</strong>In a large saucepan, cook and stir mushrooms, green peppers, onion, and garlic in oil. Stir in pasta sauce and basil; bring to a boil. Reduce heat, and simmer 15 minutes.</li>
        <li> <strong>Step 3.</strong>Mix together ricotta, 2 cups mozzarella cheese, and eggs.</li>
        <li> <strong>Step 4.</strong>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread 1 cup tomato sauce into the bottom of a greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Layer 1/2 each, lasagna noodles, ricotta mix, sauce, and Parmesan cheese. Repeat layering, and top with remaining 2 cups mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li> <strong>Step 5.</strong>Bake, uncovered, for 40 minutes. Let stand 15 minutes before serving.</li>

        <p>This is an authentic recipe for mojito. I sized the recipe for one serving, but you can adjust it accordingly and make a pitcher full. It's a very refreshing drink for hot summer days. Be careful when drinking it, however. If you make a pitcher you might be tempted to drink the whole thing yourself, and you just might find yourself talking Spanish in no time!</p>
        <ul>
            <li>10 fresh mint leaves</li>
            <li>½ medium lime, cut into 3 wedges, divided</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup ice cubes, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 ½ fluid ounces white rum</li>
            <li>½ cup club soda, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <lo>
            <li> <strong>Step 1.</strong>Place mint leaves and 1 lime wedge into a sturdy glass. Use a muddler and crush to release mint oils and lime juice.</li>
            <li> <strong>Step 2.</strong>Add remaining lime wedges and 2 tablespoons sugar, and muddle again to release the lime juice. Do not strain the mixture.</li>
            <li> <strong>Step 3.</strong>Fill the glass almost to the top with ice. Pour in rum and fill the glass with club soda.</li>
            <li> <strong>Step 4.</strong>Stir, taste, and add more sugar if desired.</li>
